# Intelligent-Iris-Species-Classification-System
This project implements an intelligent machine learning system to classify iris flower species using multiple approaches to logistic regression. Built using Python, the system explores both standard library-based models and custom-implemented algorithms to demonstrate a full understanding of classification theory and engineering problem-solving.

The project covers:

Standard Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn

Custom logistic regression (from scratch) using perceptron-inspired weight updates

Enhanced custom model with sigmoid activation for probabilistic prediction

Full evaluation pipeline including preprocessing, model training, performance comparison, and visual analysis

A key objective of this work is to bridge the conceptual gap between the perceptron algorithm and modern logistic regression while addressing numerical stability, feature scaling, and convergence challenges.

The system is applied to the classical Iris dataset, classifying flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four morphological features.
